                "review_text": "I really like this watch for the health aspects, as well as being able to respond to texts and calls quickly when away from my phone. Unfortunately, it does require your phone for pretty much everything and you can\u2019t even play music over the speaker, making it useless except for calls. You can use Bluetooth headphones with it, but it kinda sucks that you have to. The ECG is a really nice addition, but again, not super necessary (at least for me). Still - as an accessory - this is a really solid device and I use it quite a lot more than I thought I would. The fact that I can easily answer calls when driving is a huge plus, since I missed a lot of them before since I obviously didn\u2019t want to look away from the road or take my hands off the steering wheel to grab my cell phone. If you would like an accessory for convienience and health monitoring, I recommend it - it\u2019s just nothing revolutionary otherwise. It\u2019s also sucks that you have to buy a lot of the apps... I know that\u2019s not apples fault, but I expected more free apps for a nearly $400 device. :/",
